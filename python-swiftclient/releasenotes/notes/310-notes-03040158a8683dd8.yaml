features:
 - Added a copy object method.
 - Arbitrary query strings can now be passed into container functions.
 - >
   Client certificate and key can now be specified via CLI
   options (--os-cert/--os-key) or environment variables ($OS_CERT/$OS_KEY).
 - >
   A new CLI option `--ignore-checksum` can be specified to turn off
   checksum validation. In the SDK, the new `checksum=True` parameter can
   be used for the same purpose.
 - Added --json option to `swift capabilities` / `swift info`
 - Default to v3 auth if we find a (user|project)-domain-(name|id) option.
 - Added a Python version constraint of >= Py27.
 - >
   `client.py` will now retry on a 401 (auth error) even if `retries` is
   set to zero.
 - Fixed `swift download` when `marker` was specified.
 - Object segments uploaded via swiftclient are now given the content type
   "application/swiftclient-segment".
 - >
   "Directory marker" objects are now given a "application/directory"
   content type to match both Swift's `staticweb` feature and other
   ecosystem tools.
 - >
   Strip leading/trailing whitespace from headers (otherwise, new versions
   of the requests library will raise an InvalidHeader error). Additionally,
   header values with standard types (integer, float, or bool) are coerced
   to strings before being sent to a socket.
 - >
   Non-python dependencies are now specified in bindep.txt. Currently this
   only lists a single dependency for testing (PyPy), but if future
   dependencies are added, they will be included in this file.
 - Client exceptions now include response headers. One benefit is that
   this allows clients to see transaction IDs without needing to turn on
   debug logging.
 - Client connections now accept gzip-encoded responses.
 - Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.
